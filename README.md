# PackMen-exercise

## Description
Clicking "Add PacMan" button makes PacMan images appear on the page, and the "Start Game" button starts to move the PacMen at different velocities and directions. The PacMen will bounce off of the edge of the screen and change directions.
For this project, I focused on DOM manipulation, and array methods. 

## How to run
Clone all files in this repo to your local drive. Open the index.html file in a browser. First, click the "Add PacMan" button. Each click makes a new, PacMan to the page. Then, click the "Start Game" button and the PacMen will begin to move at different velocities. You can add more PacMen after starting the game.

## Roadmap of future improvements
-add background image
-add more styles to the buttons
